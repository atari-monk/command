      <h2>Welcome to the Command App</h2>
      <p>
        This is app to store your daily used commands. <br />
        <br />
        For example you can add commands for apps you use. I mean software like
        npm, webpack, docker, powershel or even your programming language or
        even math xd if you want.
        <br /> Filter them by name, description or app.
        <br />
        You can also make lists of commands for your specific projects and
        needs.
      </p>
    </div>
